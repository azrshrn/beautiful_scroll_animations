## Scroll Animations using Intersection Observer

- create html file with boilerplate code, contain 4 different section with 100 viewport height
- each element that need to animate get 'hidden' class, which use in jquery later
- in jquery, create variable which observe the element with the class 'hidden', by using querySelectorAll to grab all element which the class
- which observe, implement a condition if the element intersect, then add 'show' as class. If not, remove it.

**Thats all**<br>
**Feel free to use the code anytime.**
